**–  Note for the modelers –** 
•	Please try to be consistent with the files’ name: the TRACE file should be named _TRACE_Mesocosm_ASM_ *; the model-input table should be named _Model_input_documentation_ *, where * refers to the model name.
•	Check the name of the files you upload and “clean” them (e.g., avoid uploading a table with a date in the name). 
•	Add an information sheet or section to the extra documents you upload.
•	Specify the name of the file next to all entries above.
